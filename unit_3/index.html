<p>These days, everyone is doing yoga. It's borderlining on a fad. But...Vida Yoga is different. Vida Yoga is to live values of love, compassion, and authenticity. Discover your true Self, your true path, and find contentment where you are now...so that fullfilment can and will come at any stage in your life, regardless of your circumstances. Together, through the discipline of the postural practice, we'll uncover values that you may not yet know already exist! Values like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Tenacity</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Patience</li>
</ul>
