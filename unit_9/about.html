<p><img id="headshot" src="images/Megan Headshot.jpg" title="Megans Headshot" alt="headshot of Megan"/>My first experience in yoga was meditation. My sister had been in a bad car accident the week prior to me leaving for college and I was having a hard time adjusting to all the change. I started going to counseling at my university. My therapist, ran me through a mindfulness meditation. I didn't even know what it was at the time, but I noticed on my walk home that I was, well, noticing more. I started attending her free yoga classes twice a week.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and I started a hot and heavy love affair with hot yoga. I practiced solidly for a few years and when the opportunity came up to do my teacher training, I thought it was time. It was one of the hardest, most demanding experiences of my life, but worth it.<p>
<p>I've always been a teacher. I taught English to recently immigrated adults, I taught swim lessons, and now I teach yoga. Everyone always says, "You must be so in shape" or "You must be so flexible." The truth is, I don't necessarily think I am either...which brings me to my teaching philosphy..</p>
<p>Yoga is not exercise. I, maybe like you, treated it that way in the beginning, but it quickly became so much more than that to me. Asana (poses) helped me to work through a lot of shit in my life. They helped me to forgive myself, work through anxiety and even recognize who I am as a human, a person, a soul. But it's not the only part of yoga. There's so much more.</p>
<p>My practice has become my spiritual path. The asana facilitates the beginning of the journey, and even serves to help me maintain mind, body, soul connection. My teaching philosophy is founded in my personal practice. I am more interested in mantainence than arm balances. I am more interested in exploring how pranayama (breathwork), particularly the powerful effect of the exhale, can facilitate a deeper experience for you. You will find my classes challenging -  mostly through core work and standing poses. You won't get a particularly exciting practice with me, I care more about teaching you the fundamentals. </p>
